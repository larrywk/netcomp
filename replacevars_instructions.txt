The above programs are design aids for network deployments.

Replace Variables will replace variables in a template file.

It will ask for the name of the script template, and then ask for the
name of a comma seperated values file (*.csv). The *.csv file contains the
variable names to be replaced in the first column, and the corresponding value to
replace it with in the second column. It will then display the variable/value
pairs and the template script, and present a button to invoke doing the variable
replacement. By convention, variable names should start with a $.  When you invoke
the replace variables function, it will display whatever $ it finds in the script
so that you can be sure you have values fror all of the variables.

Compute MTBF will find the lowest MTBF path between two given nodes.

Diverse path computation will find the shortest length path that does not
traverse a list of shared risk link groups to be avoided.

As input, the programs read a file nodes.csv, which contains node names and for each node
the MTBF value for that node.  They also read spans.csv, which contains four columns, the from 
location name, the destination location name, the length of the path, and the shared risk link
group that the span in question belongs to.
